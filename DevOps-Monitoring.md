To avoid downtime and production failures, the client wants complete monitoring.
You must implement infrastructure-level monitoring.

### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring (Metrics-Based Monitoring)
#### Tools to Configure (Metrics-Based Monitoring)

* `Prometheus` → Metrics Collector
* `Node Exporter` → System Metrics (CPU, RAM, Disk)
* `MySQL Exporter` → Database Metrics
* `Grafana` → Dashboard Visualization

You may import a pre-built dashboard.
Link: https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/

Your monitoring must show:

* CPU Usage
* Memory Usage
* Disk Usage
* MySQL Query Metrics

### 2. Application Monitoring (Log-Based Monitoring)
In production, logs are critical for debugging issues.
You must implement log-based monitoring.
#### Tools to Configure (Log-Based Monitoring)

* `Loki` → Log Collector
* `Promtail` → Log Extractor
* `Grafana` → Log Visualization

You must show logs for:

* WordPress Application Error Logs
* System Authentication Logs

Logs should be searchable from Grafana dashboard.
